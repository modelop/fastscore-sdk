### Introduction

A package for Fastscore R integration, using Fastscore GoSDK. This is for the ease of R users to interact with Fastscore services directly from R.

### Example

A quick example of an interaction with Fastscore:

1. initializing Fastscore
```
library("FastscoreRSDK")
FastscoreRSDK::Connect("https://localhost:8000")
# [1] "proxy prefix: https://localhost:8000. Built on Thu Jan 10 18:18:37 UTC 2019"
Config_set("~/fastscore/config.yaml")
# [1] "Configuration set."
```
2. loading model components from corresponding local directories
```
lib <- "~/fastscore/library/"
import(list("model1.py", "model2.R"), "model", lib)
import(list("array-double", "string"), "schema", lib)
import(list("array-double-input", "string-output"), "stream", lib)
```
3. loading and firing up engine
```
Stream_attach(0, "array-double-input", "engine-1")
# [1] "Stream attached to slot 0."
Stream_attach(1, "string-output", "engine-1")
# [1] "Stream attached to slot 1."
Model_load("model1.py", "engine-1")
# [1] "Model loaded."
```
4. inspect engine work and reset
```
Engine_inspect("engine-1")
# [1] "engine-1 is finished"
Engine_reset("all")
# [1] "All engines reset."
```

### Installation

Currently this package is installed through source file and RStudio devtools.
